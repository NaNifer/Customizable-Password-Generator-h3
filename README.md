## Overview
The Customizable Password Generator is an app that generates a random password based on criteria the user has selected. 

### The challenge

The Customizable Password Generator runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The Generator has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page



### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process


This JS task seemed insumountable to me at first. The terminology, syntax, and overall construction of how the various moving parts interconnected with each other was quite confusing for me. 
I first broke the problem down into smaller sections of code, not worrying about what I needed to do next. I focused on first making the dialog boxes work, and subsequently create the output that I would use in the actual generation of the password. This included both ensuring that I was getting the results that I wanted with the happy path, as well as edge cases. 

Once that was nailed down, I refactored it, as although the dialog boxes were working, they were really, really WET.

Next, I
